b)Population and sample distributions appear generally similar, suggesting that the randomly chosen sample is somewhat representative of the larger population in terms of BMI distribution.However, the sample distribution seems slightly shifted to the left compared to the population distribution. This is reflected in the 98th percentile values:The sample's 98th percentile (43.264) is lower than the population's 98th percentile (47.526). This indicates that the sample contains a slightly lower proportion of individuals with very high BMIs compared to the overall population.Overall, the analysis suggests that the random sample of 25 observations provides a reasonable representation of the population's BMI distribution, although there might be minor deviations, especially in the tails of the distribution. Due to the random nature of sampling, a different sample of 25 observations might show a slightly different distribution and 98th percentile value.

c)It implements bootstrap resampling with replacement using the resample function and defines a compute_statistics function to calculate the average mean, standard deviation, and 98th percentile for a given DataFrame.The code calculates and prints these statistics for both the population data (df) and the bootstrap samples (sample_bootstrapped). Finally, it creates a histogram to visually compare the distribution of Blood Pressure in the population and the bootstrap samples.The bootstrap mean (71.19) is slightly higher than the population mean (69.11), suggesting a potential bias in the bootstrap estimates. This could be due to the random sampling nature of bootstrap or characteristics of specific data.The bootstrap standard deviation (17.61) is lower than the population standard deviation (19.36), indicating that the bootstrap samples might underestimate the variability of Blood Pressure in the population.The bootstrap 98th percentile (102.04) is higher than the population 98th percentile (99.32), suggesting that the bootstrap samples might overestimate the extreme values of Blood Pressure.
